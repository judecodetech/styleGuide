WELCOME TO DJANGO STYLE GUIDE GENERATOR!!!

Design studios around the world send clients (often handwritten) HTML pages displaying a standard set of HTML tags and CSS to give a site-wide view of some aspects of design that they're working on.

This HTML may contain representation of a font family, a set of 5 colours that have been chosen for the design, and an example of h1 - h6 font sizes.

This Django application can store different style guides and display a name to remember them by, and some details (like the ones mentioned above).

For the create, update, and delete operations the pre-packaged Django Admin interface is used, but for
viewing the saved data, Django templates is used to output the HTML.

Please go to /admin to add style guides.

After adding a style guide, go to /style_guides to view the style guides you have added.
